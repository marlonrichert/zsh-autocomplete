## Requirements
Recommended:
* **[Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net) 5.8** or later.

Minimum:
* Zsh 5.3 or later.


## Installation
1. `git clone` this repo. (You can optionally use a plugin manager for this.)
1. Add the following to your `.zshrc` file:
   ```zsh
   source path/to/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
   ```

### Updating
1. `cd` into `zsh-autocomplete`'s directory.
1. Do `git pull`.

(Or use your plugin manager's update mechanism).

### As a Plugin
`zsh-autocomplete` should work as a plugin with most frameworks & plugin managers. Please refer to
your framework's/plugin manager's documentation for instructions.

Note for Oh My Zsh, Prezto and Zimfw users: `zsh-autocomplete` works best if you use it
_instead_ of your framework's supplied completion module.


## Preferences
The behavior of `zsh-autocomplete` can be customized through the `zstyle` system. Just add any of
the `zstyle` lines below to your `~/.zshrc` file to change your settings.

### Wait for a minimum amount of input
By default, `zsh-autocomplete` will show completions as soon as you start typing.

To make it stay silent until a minimum number of characters have been typed:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:list-choices:*' min-input 3
```

### Shorten or lengthen the autocompletion list
By default, `zsh-autocomplete` limits the amount of automatically listed completions to 50% of the
available screen space to prevent the prompt from jumping around too much while you are typing.

To limit the list to a different height, use the following:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:list-choices:*' max-lines 100%
```
You can set this to a percentage or to a fixed number of lines. Both work.

### Always show matches in named groups
By default, completion groups and duplicates matches are shown only in certain circumstances or
when you press <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd><kbd>␣ Space</kbd>. This allows the automatic listing of
completions to be as compact and fast as possible.

To always show completions in groups (and thus show duplicates, too):
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:*' groups always
```
**WARNING:** Enabling this setting can significantly decrease responsiveness.

### Customize the autocompletion messages
You can customize the various completion messages shown.

This is shown when the number of lines needed to display all completions exceeds the number given
by [`zstyle ':autocomplete:list-choices:*' max-lines`](
#shorten-or-lengthen-the-autocompletion-list):
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:*:too-many-matches' message \
  'Too long list. Press ↓ or ⇟ to open. Type more to filter.'
```

This is shown when, for the given input, the completion system cannot find any matching completions
at all:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:*:no-matches-at-all' message 'No matching completions found.'
```

### Change Tab behavior
By default, <kbd>⇥ Tab Right</kbd> accepts the top match. The idea is that you keep typing until
the match you want is
* _at_ the top, at which point you press <kbd>⇥ Tab Right</kbd> to accept it immediately, or
* _near_ the top, at which point you press <kbd>↓ Down Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>⇟ Page Down</kbd> to
  start menu selection. Then, inside the menu, use
  * <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>→</kbd> to navigate the menu,
  * <kbd>↩︎ Return</kbd> to accept a single match,
  * <kbd>⌥ Alt</kbd><kbd>␣ Space</kbd> to accept multiple matches, and
  * <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd><kbd>␣ Space</kbd> to reveal hidden matches/info (which also works from the
    command line).

However, several alternative behaviors are available. The three settings for these (`widget-style`,
`insert-unambiguous` and `fzf`) can be combined.

To first insert any shared substrings, before completing entire words:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:tab:*' insert-unambiguous yes
```

To use menu selection:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:tab:*' widget-style menu-select
```

To cycle completions without using menu selection:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:tab:*' widget-style menu-complete
```

To try Fzf's completion before using Zsh's completion:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:tab:*' fzf yes
```

### Change other key bindings
`zsh-autocomplete` includes a set of intuitive [keyboard shortcuts](#key-bindings), mimicking those
offered by modern IDEs. However, you can override these with the `bindkey` command, if you do so
_after_ sourcing `zsh-autocomplete`:

```zsh
source path/to/zsh-autocomplete
# zsh-autocomplete defines an associative array `key` that you can use for this.
# The following lines revert the given keys back to Zsh defaults.
bindkey $key[Up] up-line-or-history
bindkey $key[Down] down-line-or-history
bindkey $key[ControlSpace] set-mark-command
```

### Disable particular completions
`zsh-autocomplete` adds a number of additional completions to Zsh's completion system. Any and all
of these can be disabled.

For example, to disable history words, recent directories and recent files:
```zsh
zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order '! history-words recent-directories recent-files' '-'
```

**Note** that this setting requires the namespace `:completion:` (and not `:autocomplete:`),
because it uses a built-in feature of Zsh's completion system. Please see [the documentation](
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#index-tag_002dorder_002c-completion-style)
for more info

### Use your own completion config
`zsh-autocomplete` comes preconfigured with its own set of sophisticated completion settings, to
ensure you have the best possible out-of-the-box experience. However, some users might prefer to
build their own suite of completion settings, to fully customize the experience.

To disable the pre-packaged config:
```zsh
zstyle ':autocomplete:*' config off
```
